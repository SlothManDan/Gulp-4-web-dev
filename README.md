# Gulp-4-web-dev
When I develop websites i like to use a gulp file to do different things. For web development i like to have live changes so i can see what i am doing, this does this by watching all the files then reloading if they are saved.It does this by using browser host to local host the website and then reload the content to the local host and then refresh the browser .It also creats mininfied versions of both css and js.

To use the gulp file open the terminal in the loocation that the file is store and us the command.

```
gulp dev
```
